			<h3>Protect Family Members</h3>
			Some members in your family may need to continue to take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19,
			including:

			<ul>
				<li>Anyone not fully vaccinated, including children under 5 years who are not eligible for COVID-19
					vaccines</li>
				<li>People with weakened immune systems or underlying medical conditions.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Omicron and other variants</h3>
			<div>The Omicron variant spreads more easily than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and how easily Omicron
				spreads compared to Delta remains unknown. Agencies expects that anyone with Omicron infection can
				spread the
				virus to others, even if they are vaccinated or donâ€™t have symptoms.</div>
			<div>Current vaccines are expected to protect against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths due to
				infection with the Omicron variant. However, breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated
				are likely to occur. With other variants, like Delta, vaccines have remained effective at preventing
				severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. The recent emergence of Omicron further emphasizes the
				importance of vaccination and boosters.</div>
