            <h3><img src="fig1.png"> Get Vaccinated and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing you from getting sick. COVID-19 vaccines are highly
                    effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.</li>
                <li>Getting vaccinated is the best way to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19
                </li>
                <li>Government recommends that everyone who is eligible stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines,
                    including people with weakened immune systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><img src="fig2.png"> Wear a mask</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Everyone ages 2 years and older should properly wear a well-fitting mask indoors in public in areas
                    of substantial or high community transmission, regardless of vaccination status.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You might choose to wear a mask regardless of the level of community transmission, if you or
                        someone in your household is at increased risk for severe disease or has a weakened immune
                        system, or if someone in your household is not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines or not
                        eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Improve how well your mask protects you, and learn about how to choose a mask to protect yourself
                    and others.</li>
                <li>People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be
                    fully protected even if they are up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines. They should continue to take
                    all precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including properly wearing a well-fitted mask,
                    until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.</li>

            <h3><img src="fig3.png"> Stay 6 feet away from others</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick, if possible. If possible, maintain 6
                    feet between the person who is sick and other household members. If you are taking care of someone
                    who is sick, make sure you properly wear a well-fitting mask and follow other steps to protect
                    yourself.</li>
                <li>Indoors in public: If you are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines, stay at least 6 feet away from
                    other people, especially if you are at higher risk of getting very sick with COVID-19.</li>

            <h3><img src="fig4.png"> Test to prevent spread to others</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tests for SARS-CoV-2(the virus that causes COVID-19) tell you if you have an infection at the time
                    of the test. This type of test is called a viral test because it looks for viral infection.</li>
                <li>Regardless of the test type you select, a positive test result means that you have an infection and
                    should isolate and inform your close contacts to avoid spreading disease to others.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 self-tests are one of many risk-reduction measures, along with vaccination, masking, and
                    physical distancing, that protect you and others by reducing the chances of spreading COVID-19.</li>

            <h3><img src="fig5.png"> Wash your hands often</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in
                    a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
                <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60%
                    alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Clean high touch surfaces regularly or as needed and after you have visitors in your home. This
                    includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets,
                    faucets, and sinks.</li>
                <li>If someone is sick or has tested positive for COVID-19, disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a household disinfectant product from <a

                        directions.</li>

                    workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.</li>
